# RSpec Pro notes

To make the task of TDD a little easier, I created this repository with examples of how to use RSpec in Ruby or Ruby On Rails applications. It is organized into three main groups:

- Subjects - Shared
- Mocks
- Built-in Matchers

> I hope it will save you time in your day-to-day as a Ruby developer.
